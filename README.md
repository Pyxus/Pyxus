### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! My name is Ezekiel, and I am a recent computer science graduate with an interest in game development and software design. I love using my programming skills to bring new ideas to life, and I'm always looking for ways to learn and grow in my field. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring my creative side through digital art and I occasionally share my latest creations on my [Instagram](instagram.com/pyxus_/). Thanks for taking the time to get to know me!

### ðŸ˜Ž About Me

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** [Fray](https://github.com/Pyxus/fray), a fighting/action game framework for the Godot game engine! As a fan of fighting games, I noticed that there is a lack of resources and tools available to aid in the development of such games. So I started building an addon that helps with some common fighting game issues, such as state management, hitbox management, and complex input detection. I work on it in my free time so development has been a little slow but I hope what I have can be of some use to someone!

- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** C++. I hope to become proficient enough to one day contribute to the Godot game engine. The plan after C++ is to try and pick up Rust.

- ðŸ”¥ **I dislike** web development. Well not really, I just don't get along with CSS sometimes.

- ðŸŽ® **Favorite Games:** Some of my favorite games are Bloodborne, Guilty Gear Strive, and .hack//G.U.

- âš¡ **Fun fact:** My username 'Pyxus' is just a combination of Pixel and Nexus. I came up with it back in middle school, it was supposed to be a clever way of saying "digital image".
